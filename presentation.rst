Texting Without Bars
====================

.. note::

    Welcome to the presenter console!

----


Use reStructuredText!
=====================

* You can use your favorite text-editor!

* Many tools available: Landslide, S5

* Convenient (and powerful!)

.. note::

    You also have a clock and a timer, so you know how much time you have
    left.

----

But then there was Prezi
========================

Sliding from left to right is no longer enough.
You need to be able to...

.. note::

    If you click on the timer it restarts from zero. This is handy when you
    are rehearsing the presentation and need to make sure it fits in the time
    allocated.

:data-y: r1000

...pan...
=========

.. note::

    If you have more notes than fit in the console, you can scroll down, but
    more handily, you can scroll the text up by pressing space bar.

----

:data-rotate: 90

...rotate...
============

.. note::

   If there isn't more text to scroll up, space bar will go to the next
   slide. Therefore you, as a presenter, just press space every time you run
   out of things to say!

:data-x: r0
:data-y: r500
:data-scale: 0.1

...and zoom!
============

.. note::

    Zooming is cool. But one day it will grow old as well. What will we do
    then to make presentations interesting?
